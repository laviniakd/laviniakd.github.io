Hi there! I'm an incoming PhD student at the University of Michigan interested in NLP, computational social science, and digital humanities. I'm advised by David Jurgens and Dallas Card.

I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Washington. My last year of undergrad I worked with Jungo Kasai on improving the use of text generation metrics.

Last summer I worked with Joshua Sunshine at Carnegie Mellon University's REUSE program on browser-based user studies in software engineering. This summer I'm working with Sofia Serrano at the University of Washington on contrastive explanation regularization.

This site is very much under construction. Please reach out to me with any questions!
