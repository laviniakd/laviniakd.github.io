Hi there! I'm a fifth-year undergraduate student at the University of Washington interested in NLP, computational social science, and digital humanities. 

This summer I worked with Joshua Sunshine at Carnegie Mellon University's REUSE program on browser-based user studies in software engineering. Right now I'm applying to PhD programs and working with Jungo Kasai (in Noah Smith's lab) on improving the use of text generation metrics.

This site is very much under construction. Please reach out to me with any questions!
