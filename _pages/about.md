Hi there! I'm an PhD student at the University of Michigan interested in NLP, computational social science, and digital humanities. Right now, I'm particularly interested in the intersection of NLP with 1) archives and 2) religious speech. I'm advised by [Dallas Card](dallascard.github.io).

I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Washington. My last year of undergrad I worked with Jungo Kasai on improving the use of text generation metrics; the summer after graduating I worked with Sofia Serrano at the University of Washington on contrastive explanation regularization.

This site is very much under construction. Please reach out to me with any questions!
