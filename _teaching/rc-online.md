I was a teaching assistant for an online course taught by Curtis Hisayasu at the University of Washington. It focused on introducing incoming freshmen to college-level English. The theme of the class was monsters; we read books like *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley and critical works like *Monster Theory: Reading Culture* by Jeffrey Jerome Cohen. My duties consisted of grading papers, working with students on developing their arguments, and assisting the instructor with the administration of the class.
